# Your program will write out 10 strings of random characters (of random length) to a file
# called exercise_five.dat (to start, Google “python generate random string”). Once the random
# strings are written out, your program will then read them back in. For each random
# string, count the number of characters. For example, if my string was ‘oStoHtpuXAipIyfSzGEmECvSppoJkmHsjogPmKkvmqMuDvnohe’,
# I would go through and count how many
# times each character appeared. You should then output each character and its count. Your
# output might look something like this:
# ***** BEGIN RANDOM STRING *****

# R ==> 1 W ==> 1 V ==> 2 Y ==> 1 X ==> 1 Z ==> 1 a ==> 1 c ==> 2 e ==> 1
# h ==> 1 k ==> 1 j ==> 1 m ==> 1 l ==> 1 o ==> 2 n ==> 1 q ==> 1 p ==> 2
